 * Perturbations are referred to as "input" and "output" perturbations. Input perturbations apply to the data used
 * when building market data, e.g. the quotes for the nodal points when building a curve. Output perturbations apply
 * to the market data in the {@link MarketDataEnvironment}, e.g. a shift applied to a calibrated curve.
