/**
 * Provides market data to functions.
 * <p>
 * In this context, market data can be a high-level object (e.g. a calibrated curve), a single simple value
 * (e.g. the market price of a security), or a time series of values.
 * <p>
 * Market data returned from the {@link #get} method is associated with a specific time, the <em>market data time</em>,
 * which is a property of a market data bundle instance. The default market data bundle created by the
 * engine has its market data time set to the valuation time. If a function needs market data for a different
 * time it should use:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   marketDataBundle.withTime(...).get(key);
 * </pre>
 *
 * If a function needs to call another function, and have that function use market data from a different date,
 * it can create a new market data bundle and pass it to the function:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   MarketDataBundle newMarketDataBundle = marketDataBundle.withTime(...);
 *   Environment newEnv = env.withMarketDataBundle(newMarketDataBundle);
 *   Result result = childFn.doSomething(newEnv, ...);
 * </pre>
