/**
 * Builds market data, either single values or time series. Market data can be simple values, for example the
 * market price of a security, or complex structures derived from market data, for example calibrated curves.
 * <p>
 * Each builder can build a single type of market data, identified by an implementation of {@link MarketDataId}.
 * The builder declares what type of market data it can build using the {@link #getKeyType()} method.
 * <p>
 * Building is a two step process. First, builders are queried to find out what data they require to satisfy
 * a set of requirements. For example, a builder for curves will return requirements for the market data
 * values of its curve nodes. Once a builder's dependencies have been created, they are passed to the builder
 * and it builds and returns the market data.
