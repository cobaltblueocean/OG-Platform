/**
 * Key for identifying values cached in a {@link FunctionCache}.
 * <p>
 * A key should uniquely identify an object, taking into account the fact that many objects can change
 * over time or if they are constructed using different data. For example, if a curve were cached the
 * valuation time should be included in the cache key, as the same curve built for a different valuation
 * time would not be the same object.
 * <p>
 * It is important to remember that the cache is shared across multiple views and multiple calculation
 * cycles. Therefore the objects in a cache key must create a key that is unique enough to identify
 * the exact version of an object that might appear in different views or other cycles.
 * <p>
 * Every key includes the type of the caller that put the value into the cache. This is to provide a kind of
 * namespace. It is quite possible for two classes to choose the same values for a cache keys by coincidence, not
 * necessarily for the same object. This would cause unintended results. Including the type of the object
 * that inserted the value greatly reduces the chances of this happening. It is assumed the function writer
 * will be aware of other uses of the cache in the same function, or can easily check.
