A simple example of calculating your own PV on an interest rate swap via an ``InterestRateSwapCalculator`` implementation can be seen in ``ThirdPartyInterestRateSwapCalculator``

Here a ``MultipleCurrencyAmount`` of $42 is returned for all PV calculations.

The ``ThirdPartyRemoteTest`` class shows how this third party implementation is fed into the ``ViewConfig`` rather than the OG specific ``InterestRateSwapCalculatorFactory`` class

With the marketdata and fullstack servers running in your IDE the ``ThirdPartyRemoteTest`` can be run against the 'remote' fullstack server.

Adding custom code to an OG server
==================================

From within your project directory run::

    mvn package

The resulting jar file is generated in the *target* folder of the project, it can then be placed in *{OG install location}/lib/*, which will be available on the classpath of the fullstack server after a restart.

This can be tested by firing up the local fullstack server rather than through the IDE and running any remote views that call into the custom code.
